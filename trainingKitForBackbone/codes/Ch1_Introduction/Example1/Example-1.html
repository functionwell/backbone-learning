		<!-- Step 1:
			Include jQuery, Here the jQuery is included with in js directory,
		    Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../../js/jquery-min.js.

		    IMPORTANT NOTE: 
		    Backbone.JS has light dependence on jQuery for DOM manipulation.	
		-->
		<script src="../../js/jquery-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 2: 
			Include Underscore, Here the Underscore is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../js/underscore-min.js

			IMPORTANT NOTE: 
			Underscore.js should always included before Backbone.JS.
			else Browser console will show error, because Backboneâ€™s only dependency is Underscore.js 
		-->	
		<script src="../../js/underscore-min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

		<!-- Step 3: 
			Include Backbone, Here the Backbone is included with in js directory,
			Thus the relative path for the file becomes ../../js/backbone.js
